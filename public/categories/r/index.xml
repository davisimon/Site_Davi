      <description>We start by defining which tickers are we going to consider in our analysis. The file “tickers.xlsx” has tickers from B3 stocks that were active in the stock exchange as of april 2018.
Download tickers.xlsx We will read it with the function read_excel, from the amazing readxl package https://readxl.tidyverse.org/
library(readxl) Brazilian stocks are found in yahoofinance with an added “.SA”. So, we add that suffix to the tickers, creating the codigo column in our tickers dataframe.</description>

      <description>First post First things first.
Why having a website? I have a lot of code and ideas to share. Why now? Had to start it at some point. What will I blog about? Accounting, Corporate Finance, Governance (Public and Corporate), Pension Funds. R programming Language, Stata, Rmarkdown. Some others things will show up, I suppose. Will I update it frequently? Highly likely. How did I do it? https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/ How long did it take?</description>
