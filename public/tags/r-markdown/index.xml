      <description>First post First things first.
Why having a website? I have a lot of code and ideas to share. Why now? Had to start it at some point. What will I blog about? Accounting, Corporate Finance, Governance (Public and Corporate), Pension Funds. R programming Language, Stata, Rmarkdown. Some others things will show up, I suppose. Will I update it frequently? Highly likely. How did I do it? https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/ How long did it take?</description>
